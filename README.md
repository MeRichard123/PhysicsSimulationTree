PhysX Simulation Assignment 
=============
The goal of the assignment was to create a simulation of a demolition which includes:
- Heavy Machinery
- A Man-made structure destroyed.

### Tech Stack
- C++
- PhysX from Nvidia
- GLUT (OpenGL)

### What were we given?
- A full rendering engine written in Opencl and C++ by my Lecturer.
- A basic abstraction over the PhysX SDK.

### What I Created
I created a tree house with a player and a chainsaw. The goal of the simulation is to use the chainsaw to chop down the tree.
I added some features to the existing engine:
- Custom Cylinder Rendering atop the existing OpenGL
- A custom particle system for simulating woodchips
